    abstract = {Motivated by the continuing interest in discrete time hidden Markov models
(HMMs), this paper reexamines these models using a risk-based approach. Simple
modifications of the classical optimization criteria for hidden path inference
lead to a new class of hidden path estimators. The estimators are efficiently
computed in the usual forward-backward manner and a corresponding dynamic
programming algorithm is also presented. A particularly interesting subclass of
such alignments are sandwiched between the most common {\em maximum a
posteriori} (MAP), or Viterbi, path estimator and the minimum error, or {\em
pointwise maximum a posteriori} (PMAP), estimator. Similar to previous work,
the new class is parameterized by a small number of tunable parameters. Unlike
their previously proposed relatives, the new parameters and class are more
explicit and have clear interpretations, and bypass the issue of numerical
scaling, which can be particularly valuable for applications.},
